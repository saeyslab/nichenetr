This vignette shows how ligand-target prior regulatory potential scores are inferred in the NicheNet framework. You can use the procedure shown here to develop your own model with inclusion of context-specific networks or removal of noisy irrelevant data sources. The networks at the basis of NicheNet can be downloaded from Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3260758.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3260758). 

# Background information about NicheNet's prior ligand-target model

The prior model at the basis of NicheNet denotes how strongly existing knowledge supports that a ligand may regulate the expression of a target gene. To calculate this ligand-target regulatory potential, we integrated biological knowledge about ligand-to-target signaling paths as follows.

First, we collected multiple complementary data sources covering ligand-receptor, signal transduction (e.g., protein-protein and kinase-substrate interactions) and gene regulatory interactions (e.g., inferred from ChIP-seq and motifs). For information of all collected data sources (link to the website of the database, etc), see [Data source information](data_sources.xlsx)

Secondly, we integrated these individual data sources into two weighted networks: 1) a ligand-signaling network, which contains protein-protein interactions covering the signaling paths from ligands to downstream transcriptional regulators; and 2) a gene regulatory network, which contains gene regulatory interactions between transcriptional regulators and target genes. 
To let informative data sources contribute more to the final model, we weighted each data source during integration. These data source weights were automatically determined via model-based parameter optimization to improve the accuracy of ligand-target predictions (see the vignette [Parameter optimization via mlrMBO](parameter_optimization.md). In this vignette, we will show how to construct models with unoptimized data source weigths as well.

Finally, we combined the ligand-signaling and gene regulatory network to calculate a regulatory potential score between all pairs of ligands and target genes. A ligand-target pair receives a high regulatory potential if the regulators of the target gene are lying downstream of the signaling network of the ligand. To calculate this, we used network propagation methods on the integrated networks to propagate the signal starting from a ligand, flowing through receptors, signaling proteins, transcriptional regulators, and ultimately ending at target genes. 

A graphical summary of this procedure is visualized here below:

Load the required packages and networks we will use to construct the model.

sig_network = readRDS(url("https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/signaling_network.rds"))

```

## Construct NicheNet's ligand-target model from unoptimized data source weights

Construct the weighted integrated ligand-signaling and gene regulatory network. In this first example, we give every data source the same weight (as given by the `source_weights_df` data frame provided by default by the nichenetr package). See the vignette showing how to use mlrMBO to optimize data source weights and the hyperparameters if interested in performing parameter optimization. For the hyperparameters of the model (hub correction factors and damping factor), we will use the optimized values (as given by the `hyperparameter_list` data frame provided by default by the nichenetr package).

The ligand-signaling network hub correction factor and gene regulatory network hub correction factor were defined as hyperparameter of the model to mitigate the potential negative influence of over-dominant hubs on the final model.
The damping factor hyperparameter is the main parameter of the Personalized PageRank algorithm, which we used as network propagation algorithm to link ligands to downstream regulators.

```{r}
# aggregate the individual data sources in a weighted manner to obtain a weighted integrated signaling network
weighted_networks = construct_weighted_networks(lr_network = lr_network, sig_network = sig_network, gr_network = gr_network, source_weights_df = source_weights_df)

# downweigh the importance of signaling and gene regulatory hubs - use the optimized parameters of this
weighted_networks = apply_hub_corrections(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, lr_sig_hub = hyperparameter_list$lr_sig_hub, gr_hub = hyperparameter_list$gr_hub)
```

Infer ligand-target regulatory potential scores based on the weighted integrated networks

```{r}
# in this example we will calculate target gene regulatory potential scores for TNF and the ligand combination TNF+IL6
ligands = list("TNF",c("TNF","IL6"))
ligand_target_matrix = construct_ligand_target_matrix(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, ligands = ligands, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = hyperparameter_list$damping_factor, ltf_cutoff = hyperparameter_list$ltf_cutoff)
```

Show some top target genes of the ligand TNF and the ligand combination TNF+IL6
```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```

```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF-IL6",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```


## Construct NicheNet's ligand-target model from optimized data source weights

Now, we will demonstrate how you can make an alternative model with the optimized data source weights (as given by the `optimized_source_weights_df` data frame provided by default by the nichenetr package)

```{r}
# aggregate the individual data sources in a weighted manner to obtain a weighted integrated signaling network
weighted_networks = construct_weighted_networks(lr_network = lr_network, sig_network = sig_network, gr_network = gr_network,source_weights_df = optimized_source_weights_df)

# downweigh the importance of signaling and gene regulatory hubs - use the optimized parameters of this
weighted_networks = apply_hub_corrections(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, lr_sig_hub = hyperparameter_list$lr_sig_hub, gr_hub = hyperparameter_list$gr_hub)

# Infer ligand-target regulatory potential scores based on the weighted integrated networks
ligands = list("TNF")

ligand_target_matrix = construct_ligand_target_matrix(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, ligands = ligands, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = hyperparameter_list$damping_factor, ltf_cutoff = hyperparameter_list$ltf_cutoff)
```

Show some top target genes of the ligand TNF 
```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```


# Change the data sources at the basis of the NicheNet ligand-target model

### Keep only specific data sources of interest

Now, we will demonstrate how you can decide which data sources to use in the model you want to create.
Let's say for this example, that you are interested in making a model that only consists of literature-derived ligand-receptor interactions, signaling and gene regulatory interactions from comprehensive databases and gene regulatory interactions inferred from ChIP-seq. An annotation of the different data sources is given by the `annotation_data_sources` data frame provided by default by the nichenetr package)

```{r}
annotation_data_sources$type_db %>% unique()
```

```{r}
data_sources_to_keep = annotation_data_sources %>% filter(type_db %in% c("literature","comprehensive_db","ChIP")) %>% pull(source)

new_source_weights_df = source_weights_df %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep)
new_lr_network = lr_network %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep) 
new_sig_network = sig_network %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep)
new_gr_network = gr_network %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep)

```

```{r}
# aggregate the individual data sources in a weighted manner to obtain a weighted integrated signaling network
weighted_networks = construct_weighted_networks(lr_network = new_lr_network, sig_network = new_sig_network, gr_network = new_gr_network, source_weights_df = new_source_weights_df)

# downweigh the importance of signaling and gene regulatory hubs - use the optimized parameters of this
weighted_networks = apply_hub_corrections(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, lr_sig_hub = hyperparameter_list$lr_sig_hub, gr_hub = hyperparameter_list$gr_hub)

# Infer ligand-target regulatory potential scores based on the weighted integrated networks
ligands = list("TNF")

ligand_target_matrix = construct_ligand_target_matrix(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, ligands = ligands, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = hyperparameter_list$damping_factor, ltf_cutoff = hyperparameter_list$ltf_cutoff)
```

Show some top target genes of the ligand TNF 
```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```

To give a second example: say that you don't trust TF-target links inferred from motif information and want to construct a model with all data sources except the motif ones.

```{r}
data_sources_to_remove = annotation_data_sources %>% filter(type_db %in% c("motif")) %>% pull(source)
data_sources_to_keep = annotation_data_sources$source %>% setdiff(data_sources_to_remove) 

new_source_weights_df = source_weights_df %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep)
new_lr_network = lr_network %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep) 
new_sig_network = sig_network %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep)
new_gr_network = gr_network %>% filter(source %in% data_sources_to_keep)

```

```{r}
# aggregate the individual data sources in a weighted manner to obtain a weighted integrated signaling network
weighted_networks = construct_weighted_networks(lr_network = new_lr_network, sig_network = new_sig_network, gr_network = new_gr_network, source_weights_df = new_source_weights_df)

# downweigh the importance of signaling and gene regulatory hubs - use the optimized parameters of this
weighted_networks = apply_hub_corrections(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, lr_sig_hub = hyperparameter_list$lr_sig_hub, gr_hub = hyperparameter_list$gr_hub)

# Infer ligand-target regulatory potential scores based on the weighted integrated networks
ligands = list("TNF")

ligand_target_matrix = construct_ligand_target_matrix(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, ligands = ligands, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = hyperparameter_list$damping_factor, ltf_cutoff = hyperparameter_list$ltf_cutoff)
```

Show some top target genes of the ligand TNF 
```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```


### Add own data sources to the NicheNet model

In addition to removing data sources, you can also add new data sources. This could for example help you in making context-specific models, if you would have a network or data containing context-specific interactions of interest.

As input, we require a data source to contain directional interactions between genes: these interactions are protein-protein or signaling interactions for ligand-receptor and signaling data sources and a gene regulatory interaction for gene regulatory data sources. The data sources should be formatted in a data frame with following columns: from, to and source. "from" denotes the source node "gene A" of the directional interaction from gene A to B, "to" denotes the target node "gene B" of this directional interaction, and "source" is a user-defined name of this data source.

Here, we will show how you can download, process and integrate an online data source within the NichenNet framework. As example, this is the data source "Hub Proteins Protein-Protein Interactions" from the Harmonizome portal (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/dataset/Hub+Proteins+Protein-Protein+Interactions).


```{r}
input_file = "https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/static/hdfs/harmonizome/data/hubs/gene_attribute_edges.txt.gz"
ppi_network = read_tsv(input_file, col_names = TRUE)

ppi_network = ppi_network %>% transmute(from=target,to=source) %>% 
    filter(from %in% geneinfo_human$symbol & to %in% geneinfo_human$symbol) # keep only interactions between genes with oficial gene symbols: optional step

# give your data source a name
ppi_network = ppi_network %>% mutate(source = "harmonizome_hub_ppi", database = "harmonizome") 

head(ppi_network)
```

First, we will add this new data source to all other data sources. Because this data sources contains intracellular protein-protein interactions, we will consider this data source as a signaling data source. As example, we will assign to this data source a weight of 1, because we want it to have a strong contribution to the final model.

```{r}
new_sig_network = sig_network %>% bind_rows(ppi_network)

new_network_weights_df = tibble(source = "harmonizome_hub_ppi", weight = 1)
new_source_weights_df = optimized_source_weights_df %>% bind_rows(new_network_weights_df)
```

Now make this model

```{r}
# aggregate the individual data sources in a weighted manner to obtain a weighted integrated signaling network
weighted_networks = construct_weighted_networks(lr_network = lr_network, sig_network = new_sig_network, gr_network = gr_network, source_weights_df = new_source_weights_df)

# downweigh the importance of signaling and gene regulatory hubs - use the optimized parameters of this
weighted_networks = apply_hub_corrections(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, lr_sig_hub = hyperparameter_list$lr_sig_hub, gr_hub = hyperparameter_list$gr_hub)

# Infer ligand-target regulatory potential scores based on the weighted integrated networks
ligands = list("TNF")

ligand_target_matrix = construct_ligand_target_matrix(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, ligands = ligands, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = hyperparameter_list$damping_factor, ltf_cutoff = hyperparameter_list$ltf_cutoff)
```

Show some top target genes of the ligand TNF 
```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```

In some cases, it's possible that you want that your data source will be considered as only data source in a specific layer (i.e. ligand-receptor, signaling or gene regulatory layer). Therefore, we will show how you use this new data source as only data source part of the signaling network. 

```{r}
new_sig_network = ppi_network

new_network_weights_df = tibble(source = "harmonizome_hub_ppi", weight = 1)
new_source_weights_df = optimized_source_weights_df %>% bind_rows(new_network_weights_df)
```

```{r}
# aggregate the individual data sources in a weighted manner to obtain a weighted integrated signaling network
weighted_networks = construct_weighted_networks(lr_network = lr_network, sig_network = new_sig_network, gr_network = gr_network, source_weights_df = new_source_weights_df)

# downweigh the importance of signaling and gene regulatory hubs - use the optimized parameters of this
weighted_networks = apply_hub_corrections(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, lr_sig_hub = hyperparameter_list$lr_sig_hub, gr_hub = hyperparameter_list$gr_hub)

# Infer ligand-target regulatory potential scores based on the weighted integrated networks
ligands = list("TNF")

ligand_target_matrix = construct_ligand_target_matrix(weighted_networks = weighted_networks, ligands = ligands, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = hyperparameter_list$damping_factor, ltf_cutoff = hyperparameter_list$ltf_cutoff)
```

Show some top target genes of the ligand TNF 
```{r}
extract_top_n_targets("TNF",10,ligand_target_matrix)
```

## Final note

Most optimally, you would like to optimize the parameters again when including own data sources. Instructions to do this are given in the following vignette: 
[Parameter optimization via mlrMBO](parameter_optimization.md): `vignette("parameter_optimization", package="nichenetr")`

However, this optimization process takes a lot of time and requires the availability of multiple cores to perform the optimization in parallel. Because we demonstrate in the NicheNet paper that unoptimized models also perform considerably well, data source weight optmization is not necessary to have decent predictive ability.
