\title{Construct a ligand-tf signaling probability matrix for ligands of interest.}
\usage{
construct_ligand_tf_matrix(weighted_networks, lr_network, ligands, ltf_cutoff = 0.99, algorithm = "PPR", damping_factor = 0.5, ligands_as_cols = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{weighted_networks}{A list of two elements: lr_sig: a data frame/ tibble containg weighted ligand-receptor and signaling interactions (from, to, weight); and gr: a data frame/tibble containng weighted gene regulatory interactions (from, to, weight)}

\item{lr_network}{A data frame / tibble containing ligand-receptor interactions (required columns: from, to, source)}

\item{ligands}{A list of all ligands and ligand-combinations of which target gene probability scores should be calculated. Example format: list("TNF","BMP2",c("IL4","IL13")).}

\item{ltf_cutoff}{Ligand-tf scores beneath the "ltf_cutoff" quantile will be set to 0. Default: 0.99 such that only the 1 percent closest tfs will be considered as possible tfs downstream of the ligand of choice.}

\item{algorithm}{Selection of the algorithm to calculate ligand-tf signaling probability scores. Different options: "PPR" (personalized pagerank), "SPL" (shortest path length) and "direct"(just take weights of ligand-signaling network as ligand-tf weights + give the ligand itself the max score). Default and recommended: PPR.}

\item{damping_factor}{Only relevant when algorithm is PPR. In the PPR algorithm, the damping factor is the probability that the random walker will continue its walk on the graph; 1-damping factor is the probability that the walker will return to the seed node. Default: 0.5.}

\item{ligands_as_cols}{Indicate whether ligands should be in columns of the matrix and target genes in rows or vice versa. Default: FALSE}
}
\value{
A matrix containing ligand-target probability scores.
}
\description{
\code{construct_ligand_tf_matrix} Convert integrated weighted networks into a matrix containg ligand-tf probability scores. The higher this score, the more likely a particular ligand can signal to a downstream gene.
