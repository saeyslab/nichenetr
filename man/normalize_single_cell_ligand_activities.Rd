\title{Normalize single-cell ligand activities}
\usage{
normalize_single_cell_ligand_activities(ligand_activities)
}
\arguments{
\item{ligand_activities}{Output from the function `predict_single_cell_ligand_activities`.}
}
\value{
A tibble giving the normalized ligand activity scores for single cells. Following columns in the tibble: $cell, $ligand, $pearson, which is the normalized ligand activity value.
}
