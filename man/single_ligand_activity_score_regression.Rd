\title{Perform a correlation and regression analysis between cells' ligand activities and property scores of interest}
\usage{
single_ligand_activity_score_regression(ligand_activities, scores_tbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{ligand_activities}{Output from the function `normalize_single_cell_ligand_activities`.}

\item{scores_tbl}{a tibble containing scores for every cell (columns: $cell and $score). The score should correspond to the property of interest}
}
\value{
A tibble giving for every ligand, the correlation/regression coefficients giving information about the relation between its activity and the property of interest.
}
\description{
\code{single_ligand_activity_score_regression} Performs a correlation and regression analysis between cells' ligand activities and property scores of interest.
