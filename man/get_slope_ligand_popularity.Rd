\title{Regression analysis between ligand popularity and target gene predictive performance}
\usage{
get_slope_ligand_popularity(metric, performances)
}
\arguments{
\item{metric}{The name of the performance metric of which the trend with the popularity of the ligand should be calculated.}

\item{performances}{A data.frame in which the performance measures for target gene predictions of ligands are denoted together with the popularity of the ligand. (should contain at least following variables: ligand, ncitations and the metric of interest)}
}
\value{
A data.frame in which the regression coefficient estimate, p-value and corresponding R-squared value are shown for the regression analysis to investigate the trend between a particular classficiation evaluation metric and the popularity of the ligand.
}
\description{
\code{get_slope_ligand_popularity}: Performs regression analysis to investigate the trend between a particular classficiation evaluation metric and the popularity of the ligand.
