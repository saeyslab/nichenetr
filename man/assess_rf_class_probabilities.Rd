\title{Assess probability that a target gene belongs to the geneset based on a multi-ligand random forest model}
\usage{
assess_rf_class_probabilities(round,folds,geneset,background_expressed_genes,ligands_oi,ligand_target_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{round}{Integer describing which fold of the cross-validation scheme it is.}

\item{folds}{Integer describing how many folds should be used.}

\item{geneset}{Character vector of the gene symbols of genes of which the expression is potentially affected by ligands from the interacting cell.}

\item{background_expressed_genes}{Character vector of gene symbols of the background, non-affected, genes (can contain the symbols of the affected genes as well).}

\item{ligands_oi}{Character vector giving the gene symbols of the ligands you want to build the multi-ligand with.}

\item{ligand_target_matrix}{The NicheNet ligand-target matrix denoting regulatory potential scores between ligands and targets (ligands in columns).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: $gene, $response, $prediction. Response indicates whether the gene belongs to the geneset of interest, prediction gives the probability this gene belongs to the geneset according to the random forest model.

\description{
\code{assess_rf_class_probabilities} Assess probability that a target gene belongs to the geneset based on a multi-ligand random forest model (with cross-validation). Target genes and background genes will be split in different groups in a stratified way.
