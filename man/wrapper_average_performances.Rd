\title{Calculate average performance of datasets of a specific ligand.}
\usage{
wrapper_average_performances(ligand_oi,performances, averaging = "median")
}
\arguments{
\item{ligand_oi}{Name of the ligand for which datasets should be averaged.}

\item{performances}{A data frame with performance values, containing at least folowing variables: $setting, $ligand and one or more metrics.}

\item{averaging}{How should performances of datasets of the same ligand be averaged? 'median' or 'mean'.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing classification evaluation measures for the ligand activity state prediction single, individual feature importance measures.
}
\description{
\code{wrapper_average_performances} Calculate average performance of datasets of a specific ligand. Datasets profiling more than one ligand (and thus ligands other than the ligand of interest), will be included as well.
