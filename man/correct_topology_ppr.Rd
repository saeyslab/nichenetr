\title{Adapt a ligand-target probability matrix construced via PPR by correcting for network topolgoy.}
\usage{
correct_topology_ppr(ligand_target_matrix,weighted_networks,ligands_position = "cols")
}
\arguments{
\item{ligand_target_matrix}{A matrix of ligand-target probabilty scores.}

\item{weighted_networks}{A list of two elements: lr_sig: a data frame/ tibble containg weighted ligand-receptor and signaling interactions (from, to, weight); and gr: a data frame/tibble containng weighted gene regulatory interactions (from, to, weight)}

\item{ligands_position}{Indicate whether the ligands in the ligand-target matrix are in the rows ("rows") or columns ("cols"). Default: "cols"}
}
\value{
A matrix containing ligand-target probability scores, after subtracting target scores solely due to network topology.
}
\description{
\code{correct_topology_ppr} The ligand-target probability scores of a matrix constructed via personalized pagerank will be subtracted by target probability scores calculated via global pagerank; these latter scores can be considered as scores solely attributed to network topology and not by proximity to the ligand of interest. Recommended to use this function in combination with a ligand-target matrix constructed without applying a cutoff on the ligand-tf matrix.

## Generate the ligand-target matrix from loaded weighted_networks
